Addition: Rulers do not follow this rule.

This contract cannot be a trade contract. It must be a agreement. For instance, A lord allows you to live in his land aslong as you follow his rules. And you sign a contract saying you shall follow the rules. And then you go around stealing. You can be executed for that.

During Raids, rulers do not follow FearRP rules. Instead if they refuse to surrender and they die, instead of being dead in lore. They are put into the other teams prison. This is to make the server more interesting and keep characters alive longer. When you have captured a ruler. You are in a much more powerful position. You can threaten them to give up their crown through FearRP. The terms must be fair and cannot be a 100% takeover. Make a ticket if this is what you wish to do. Keep in mind a ruler can refuse. but Killing them is not wise as if you do so. Their team can always elect a new leader.","Ships can be stolen during Raids If you have not anchored a ship. Then it may be stolen during a raid.","Raids can only happen if atleast 20% off a team is online. or more than 5 players are online","The Defenders are informed 10 minutes before a raid, because they would have scouts in the area to inform them of incoming attacks.","If one side of a raid doesn't have their leader online then they cannot capture the oppositions leader. by leader, this is refering to the ruler of the land, not the Nation.
