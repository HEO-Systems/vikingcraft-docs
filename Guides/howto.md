# How to play the Server
So if your reading this you need advice or are confused on how you play the server in a way that is fun and also doesn't break the rules.

You must use Simple-Voicechat for 1.21.1

1. Do not make throwaway characters, If you want to have fun and be respected. Put time and effort aswell as thought into your characters. And follow the values you set to your character. If he is nice, don't go around and burn villages.

2. Try to tell a story, We want to make stories of conflicts and cool-things you guys create and post them on youtube. So make it make sense.

3. Try not to preplan lore, Preplanning is boring and it will ruin your fun, aswell as it is frowned upon

4. Have fun and don't take the server too seriously. If you die you can make a new character. This isn't real life

5. Try to fit in with the enviroment, This means do not build structures which are not Viking-themed or have a 2014 Gamerboy skin
