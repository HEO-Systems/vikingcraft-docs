Advice on how to conduct roleplay in-regards to the rules

### How to conduct lore and roleplay:

1. Do not make throwaway characters. If you want to have fun and be respected, put time and effort as well as thought into your characters. And follow the values you set for your character. If he is nice, don't go around and burn villages.

2. Try to tell a story. We want to make stories of conflicts and cool things you guys create and post them on YouTube. So make it make sense.

3. Try not to preplan lore. Preplanning is boring and it will ruin your fun, as well as it is frowned upon.

4. Have fun and don't take the server too seriously. If you die you can make a new character. This isn't real life.

5. Try to fit in with the environment. This means do not build structures which are not Viking-themed or have a 2014 Gamerboy skin.
