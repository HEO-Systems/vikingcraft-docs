# Mining
### I'm mining, I barely find any minerals.. why?

Well you see dear reader, Vikingcraft has limited ores. Diamonds generate beneath Islands in very few quantities and Iron spawns on extremely-tall mountains.

So you might ask. Do the server-staff hate you, and want you to grind 4 hours for a set of basic-gear? **No of-course not**

You need to create mines. the better the mines, the better qualitiy of ores you recieve. A Nation can only have 1 Mine per 4 towns inside it. Diamond Mines are not creatable, same with gold-mines. However they exist, and will be able to be found in the future!

```The Idea: the intention is to encourage nation-building for resources and for people not to just go mining underneath the sea for the whole day.```
