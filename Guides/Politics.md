# Politics
This is our political-map, You are a noble if you own one of the regions on this map are apart of a family which does:

To claim a area a province/town on the map you need atleast 5 people and some sort of buildings/campsite there. Which you can build.

All the land on the server is claimed. however you can still build, destroy and set-up there. Once you occupy a region the Lord of it can change the permissions by using the command **/t set perm [group] [permission] [on/off]**

As less and less regions are free to be taken, more and more players will be required to claim them.



**Ruling Titles and Requirements:**

**Karl:** Ruler of atleast 1 Territory, has atleast 5 men under his command and spread between his towns/provinces  

**Jarl:** Ruler of atleast 1 Territory, has atleast 10 men under his command and spread between his towns/provinces

**Earl:** Ruler of atleast 2 Territories, has atleast 10 men under his command spread between his towns/provinces

**King:** Ruler of atleast 6 Territories, has atleast 15 men under his command spread between his towns/provinces

**Emperor:** Ruler of atleast one of the 3:  Norway, Sweden or Finland, 30 men under his command spread between his towns/provinces

People without the requirements for a singular territory won't be able to have a territory therefore will not have a Noble-rank

**Territory Guide:**
If a Territory is **LIGHT-GREEN** on the dynamic-map, this mean it is wilderness. You can mine, build, destroy and use items inside **Wilderness Territories.**

if a Wilderness Territory gets claimed and you are the mayor of the Territory, this is how you change the permissions for specific people

/town set perm [group] [permission] [off/on]

**For example: /town set perm outsider build off**

To claim a territory you need 5 people. 

Hey, what if I have multiple territories in my **Nation**:
Once you gain more territories the capital-town alongside any-towns that the Nation-Leader wants permissions to access that territory will be granted permission to use anything they want in that territory

If your territories do not have mayors, you cannot protect them from things such as breaking/building/stealing. So I recommend you do not overclaim unless you have the men to equip your land.

To quickly grant someone full permissions to a territory/town you can do /t trust or /t trusttown depending if you want their whole town to have access to your town.
