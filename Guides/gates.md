# Siege Defenses
Siege Defenses consist of:
1. **Gates**: Openable Doors which act as the major-enterances for Castles, Keeps and Cities

2. **Drawbridges**: Drawable Bridges that act as passage-ways for rivers

3. **Portcullis'**: Gates and Bridges combined into one, the most defensive of the three.
