# Ships and Vehicles
Our server has moveable ships and siege-weapons!

**How to control a vehicle:**
1. Signs: You need 3 Signs, The Craft name [**Eg:** Longship], a Release sign [**Release**] which releases the vehicle, And a Cruise sign which allows you to cruise in the specific direction the sign is facing [**Cruise: OFF**]

2. To rotate the ship you do /rotate left or right or use a sign with the name of [Helm] on it. **It may have a bug however**

3. To drive the vehicle 1 block at a time, use a compass-item and right-click. Left clicking will put you in direct control mode, This means the craft will move in the direction you are moving

### How to build vehicles and ships?: 
First of all these are the vehicles:
1. **Trading Ships:** These are pretty slow, do not carry any siege-weaponry on them.

2. **Longship:** These are pretty fast and can carry ballistas on them yet less cargo. The maximum size is 1500 blocks

3. **Siegetower:** Slow, can only be 25 blocks high and cannot carry siege-weapons yet provide cover

4. **Catapult:** Slow, and can fire cobblestone

5. **Ballista:** Medium Speed, can fire explosive arrows that deal high-damage

Ships must be primarly wood or else they will not let you sail them and they cannot be connected to other blocks. Or else they will merge with them
