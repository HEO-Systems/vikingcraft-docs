# General Rules
Vikingcraft has an extensive set of rules to ensure everyone has fun and nothing is abused 
## Basic Rules
1. **Common Sense** | Common Sense means you understand the basic idea of the server, and just because something isn't clearly stated in the rules, you still have the common-sense to know it's not allowed

2. **Hacking** | Hacking of any sort, including Xray is bannable

3. **Discrimination** | Don't harass or attack anyone just because of the color of their skin, their disabilities or their sexuality. Be a kind person

4. **Toxicity** | Do not be overly toxic, being mad in the moment is fine, but don't harass or take the game too seriously

5. **Do not steal** / **kill** or **attack** anybody outside of **Active Hours**

## Character Rules
Characters are who you play on the server, characters create stories

**How to create a character**:

1. Characters must fit their description, if you say your character is peaceful, and kind, you cannot simply go around on the server murdering people, You can evolve your character through roleplay and interactions. But you must fit your emotions. This also means you need to have a skin related to your character description

2. Characters under 18 cannot marry, [**OOC: If you are 18 you cannot marry under 18 year olds, if you are below 18 you cannot marry over 18 year-olds to keep it not-weird**]

3. **If your character dies** you cannot join back the same-team for 1 week which is 1-year in lore on a new character, you lose all your skills, all your rankings, and your next character cannot be a part of the same family as the last, you also loose all your items, and are unwhitelisted until you create a new-character

4. **The only information your characters may use is the information they are told face to face in roleplay** during Active Hours, They can also use any information which a owner verifies

5. Admins cannot have characters.

6. **Character names must be realistic** and cannot directly copy a movie-character name. Be original

7. **When Characters die in minecraft**, in lore it is known as a Knockout, The ways of characters actually dying in lore, and not being able to be played anymore are listed below

8. **A Character can only master one class**, there are 3 classes to choose from, Axeman, Archer, Swordsman

9. **If you are a champion** you must renew your allegiance to your god weekly, if you do, during that week you cannot disobey the God you follow under a binding contract

10. **Characters are recognisable by voices and skins**, You cannot change your skin but you can mask yourself with armor as nametags are turned off.

## How a Character can die?
Characters may only die in **Active-Hours**

1. Breaking FearRP, when your character is outnumbered 4 to 1 you can be placed under fear-rp, If you disobey the people who have put you under FearRP demands then they can kill you and it will count as a character-death, The demands must be reasonable and cannot be something like jump into this volcano. For every 1 person, you need 4 others to outnumber them. To capture 3 people, you need 12.
