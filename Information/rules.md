# General Rules
```Vikingcraft has an extensive set of rules to ensure everyone has fun and nothing is abused```
## Basic Rules

2. **Hacking** | Hacking of any sort, including Xray is bannable

3. **Discrimination** | Don't harass or attack anyone just because of the color of their skin, their disabilities or their sexuality. Be a kind person

10. **Siege Towers may not be over 25 blocks tall**, This also means your walls cant be over 25 blocks tall unless approved by Staff 

## Character Rules
Characters are who you play on the server, characters create stories

**How to create a character**:

Format | Character Information
--- | ---
**Name of Character** | Put in the name of your character must be Nordic themed ending in son or daughter [Bjorn Ragnar**son** as a example]
**Age of Character** | The age of your character must be at least 13, your character cannot marry until it is 18, 
**Family of Character** | List any family that the character has. Once set, it cannot be changed.
**Description of character** | Describe the way your character looks and its personality
**Backstory of Character** | a backstory of your character's upbringing and what has led him to be where he is, Don't give yourself stolen valor, keep it simple [**100 Words Minimum**]

1. Characters must fit their description, if you say your character is peaceful, and kind, you cannot simply go around on the server murdering people, You can evolve your character through roleplay and interactions. But you must fit your emotions. This also means you need to have a skin related to your character description

2. Characters under 18 cannot marry, [**OOC: If you are 18 you cannot marry under 18 year olds, if you are below 18 you cannot marry over 18 year-olds to keep it not-weird**]

3. **If your character dies** you cannot join back the same-team for 1 week which is 1-year in lore on a new character, you lose all your skills, all your rankings, and your next character cannot be a part of the same family as the last, you also loose all your items, and are unwhitelisted until you create a new-character

4. **The only information your characters may use is the information they are told face to face in roleplay** during Active Hours, They can also use any information which a owner verifies

5. Admins cannot have characters.

6. **Character names must be realistic** and cannot directly copy a movie-character name. Be original

7. **When Characters die in minecraft**, in lore it is known as a Knockout, The ways of characters actually dying in lore, and not being able to be played anymore are listed below

8. **A Character can only master one class**, there are 3 classes to choose from, Axeman, Archer, Swordsman

9. **If you are a champion** you must renew your allegiance to your god weekly, if you do, during that week you cannot disobey the God you follow under a binding contract

10. **Characters are recognisable by voices and skins**, You cannot change your skin but you can mask yourself with armor as nametags are turned off.

11. **Characters must have a reason for harming one another** you cannot just go around wanting to execute innocent civilians because your pvp-hungry. You must have a reasonable motive. This rule also means escalation. You can't instantly assassinate a Jarl because you want to usurp his throne. First try to ask him and convince him to give up his position. and slowly build up to the point of no return. If you are confused make a Lore-Ticket.

## How a Character can die?
Characters may only die in **Active-Hours**

1. Breaking FearRP, when your character is outnumbered 4 to 1 you can be placed under fear-rp, If you disobey the people who have put you under FearRP demands then they can kill you and it will count as a character-death, The demands must be reasonable and cannot be something like jump into this volcano. For every 1 person, you need 4 others to outnumber them. To capture 3 people, you need 12.

2. Dying while attempting to permanently kill another person, during a coup for instance.

3. Anyone who kills a member of your **direct family** can be killed as apart of a revenge-killing, This is because your starting a vendetta with a family, This is only valid for 2-years in lore, so if you wait too long it invalidates the Vendetta.
**Addition:** Rulers do not follow this rule. Rulers can only start vendettas with other ruling families inside other regions. 


4. **Breaking a Contract:** Contracts are lore-agreements that 2 parties sign inside a book, They are binding and if you break one intentionally you can be killed. This contract cannot be a trade contract. It must be a agreement. 
For instance, A lord allows you to live in his land aslong as you follow his rules. And you sign a contract saying you shall follow the rules. And then you go around stealing. You can be executed for that. **If a contract is broken, you can only avenge it within 1 Year in lore** [Which is 1 week in real-life] Contracts cannot be silly. and must make sense in lore.

5. **Dying in a duel to the death**: There are two types of duels to the death. Firstly you can agree to one with someone, in which the loser has their character permanently killed. Or one can be forced upon you if you loose in Court.

### War, Raiding and Conflict Rules:
To start off, this is a Viking server, war is frequent and it is even encouraged. Losing a battle doesn't always mean the end of your Empire. This is not how we want things to end. Great Empires should fall gradually not in one swift victory. 

#### Raiding:
1. You can raid as many settlements as you want, However after you raid a settlement you cannot raid another one in that nation or the same one for atleast **2 Hours**. Also raiding is only allowed during **Active Hours**

2. **Raiding is the act of going into a settlement, breaching or attempting to breach it and killing players**. During Raids you can bring Ships. Keep in mind that Explosions are off inside towns and are only enabled during War. 

3. **The only person capturable during a Raid are Rulers**. Rulers are the masterminds behind planning. They usually sit in the back and let their men do the brute-work. Real Warrior Kings lead by the front, however they don't have to. a Ruler can only be captured if all of his men are dead and he is outnumbered 4 to 1. During Raids, rulers do not follow FearRP rules. Instead if they refuse to surrender and they die, instead of being dead in lore. They are put into the other teams prison. **This is to make the server more interesting and keep characters alive longer. When you have captured a ruler. You are in a much more powerful position. You can threaten them to give up their crown through FearRP. The terms must be fair and cannot be a 100% takeover. Make a ticket if this is what you wish to do. Keep in mind a ruler can refuse. but Killing them is not wise as if you do so. Their team can always elect a new leader.**

4. **Ships can be stolen during Raids** If you have not anchored a ship. Then it may be stolen during a raid.

5. **Raids can only happen if atleast 20% off a team is online. or more than 5 players are online**

6. **The Defenders are informed 10 minutes before a raid**, because they would have scouts in the area to inform them of incoming attacks.

7. **If one side of a raid doesn't have their leader online then they cannot capture the oppositions leader**. by leader, this is refering to the ruler of the land, not the Nation. So if IgnWu is the Jarl of Jomsborg. and he is not online. You cannot capture a leader who raids you. This is to keep it fair and interesting.



#### Conflict Rules:
1. You cannot instantly start wars over lands. Instead negotiate, Raid the lands you want to occupy atleast a few times. Then eventually if you've tried all your cards. **Threaten to go to War.**

2. **Ordinary Soldiers** cannot be killed during conflicts simply for following orders. They also can't be captured because what use does capturing a ordinary soldier of a dozen have. None. The only peopel capturable during War times that are able to kept behind bars are: **Generals**, **Great Warriors [This will be explain on another page]** , **Rulers** , **Nobility** , **The Family of a Ruler**

3. **You can only execute people for good reason**, Good reason for instance being: Breaking Treaties, killing one of your family members or harming your nation personally in a way which was not following orders but acting in their own self-interest. The advice of the staff team is to make a lore-ticket and consult with staff before escalating

#### War Rules:
